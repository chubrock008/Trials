So this is a new note series for coding
to create a new file using git bash we use the command 
    $ touch 'name of file.extension'(e.g touch index.html)

To create a git repository in a folder, 
    we have to first, add the folder to our workspace, then open the 
    folder in a our file explorer, right click, select the git bash 
    option. this will open up the dialogue box. then we input the command
    "$ git init" this will create a repository for your works here. FYI this 
    folder will be hidden, so to see it, we might have to enable hidden files

We also have to add our name and email address to the git repository. This is 
done with the following command
    $ git config --global user.name 'chubrock'
    $ git config --global user.email 'forchuby@gmail.com'

When we are stuck, we could ask git for help with the following command
    $ git help <verb>
    $ git <verb> --help

We can see a list of all the files we have in the directory with the command;
    $ ls will list all the vissible files in the directory
    $ ls -la will list all files (both hidden and visible) files in the directory

 If we want to stop trackinig a project all we have to do is delete the .git
 directory, we can do this 2 ways by physically deleting the directory/folder
 from file explorer or using the command below
    $ rm -rf .git   

Now that we have created a master repisotory we can add files, with the command:
    $ git add index.html 'to add individual file'
    
    $ git status "gives us the status of the files added, that are waiting
                  to be committed"

There are multiple ways to remove files from the staging area, they are shown below
    $ git rm --cached "file name" removes the git file from the commited branch.
    $ git reset will remove all files from the stagging area
    $ git reset log.txt will remove the particular file
    
    $ git add *.html will add all files with ".html" attached to them
    $ git  add -A will add all untracked files to the staging area
    $ git add "." will add all the files in the directory to the master
   
    $ git commit will commit all files in the staging area. when using Visual Studio
        Code, a pop will appear on the editor. remove the '#' infront of the initial 
        commit, save (i think) then close the window to approve commit. there's a 2nd 
        method which will be shown below.
   
    $ git commit -m 'coment goes here' (e.g $ commit -m 'changed app.js'). the -m stands
        for message hence we add the ''. this way we can track all the commits,
        that is why it is important to leave good reference messages.
    
    $ git log shows all the commits that have been carried out in that particular directory

If the command line editor is cluttered you can clear the screen by using the command below    
    $ clear this removes everything on the bash dialogue box.
    
    $ touch ".gitignore" will create a ignore folder for git. this cant be created in 
        file explorer as windows will think its a empty name file. so it has to be created 
        on the bash command line interface.
        All files added to this file/folder will not be committed. To add files to this 
        directory all we do is input the name of the file, in the .gitignore directory 
        on our editor. E.g (open .gitignore on the editor and type in log.txt and save).
        all changes made to this file wont show up when checking status and wont be uploaded
        to the master repository.
        It is also possible to exclude entire directories as well, this can be done by
        adding the directory to the ignore repository like this 
        "/dir1" [r "/dir2"] in the .gitignore directory.

We can create a branch in the master directory, this way if i am working with multiple people 
i can still work on my own piece of the code without affecting what the others are doing. it is
useful when i want to work on specific areas of the code or a specific feature, i can create a 
branch and play around with before merging to the master. the command for creating branches are 
as follows

    $ git branch "chuby's branch"

If we want to switch to the branch we want to work on. In this case it is chuby's branch, so the 
above listed command will take us there and all changes we make there will be committed to that 
branch as opposed to the master branch. 

    $ git checkout chuby's branch, 

    $ git checkout login will allow us to switch from the master branch to the local branch 
        we want to edit, which will be the "login branch" in this instance. When we switch to 
        the login branch we can edit changes locally that can be added later to the master

you can clone a remote repository by using the command below, this will probably be how most tasks
will be gotten (for employees) so we clone the directory and work on our own tasks
   
    $ git clone <url> <where to clone> (e.g $ git clone https://github.com/Corey/remote_repo.git .)
    $ git clone ../remote_repo.git .
    the "." refers to this current directory

To view information about the remote repository we use the following commands

    $ git remote -v (shows information about repository)
    $ git branch -a (showns information about the branch)

To keep an online backup of your code, we can upload them to github. see the command below

    $ git remote shows all the active repositories
        to add your own repository, go to github and copy the repository address like below

    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/chubrock008/Collection1.git this allows us to a
        repository where we publish/upload our code to a specific git repository. This repository 
        is created on github and we can get the necessary address/path from there.

After we have completed our task for/with the code, we will want to push it to the central 
repository, especiially in cases where there are multiple people working on the same code, and 
they have been pushing code to that repository we want to pull all the changes in code from the
the repository before we add our own changes. find below commands for pull and push

    $ git pull -u origin master
    $ git pull origin master

    $ git push -u origin master 
    $ git push origin master

This allows to push our code to the master repository on our github. here the "-u" means that, we 
want git to associate the local branch/master with the remote branch/master. this way we dont have to 
include "-u" in future push requests, we can just say push origin master

If we want to merge a branch, its advisable to create a pull request from the master branch just to 
make sure that we have the most updated version of the code, before we initialize the merge. this can be
done with the command below

If we want to merge a local branch to the master branch we use the command
    
    $ git merge <branch name> 

If we want to see the merged files we use the command

    $ git branch --merged
    
After merging the local branch to the master, we can delete the local branch as it is no longer useful
to us. this can be achieved with the following command

    $ git branch -d "branch name" (in this case -d = delete)
    
We can also delete the branch from the remote repository, this is achieved with the input below
 
    $ git push origin --delete "branch name"
